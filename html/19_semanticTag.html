        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/Abdul Kalam/ (listen); 15 October 
            1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who 
            served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born 
            and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace 
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science 
            administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
            (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately 
            involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile 
            development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of 
            India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
            vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, 
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, 
            the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974</p>
